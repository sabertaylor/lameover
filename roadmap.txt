Roadmap
=======

Sprint 1:

- Be able to set daily time limit that counts application run time cumulatively
  Test with Spectromancer.exe and Hearthstone.exe.
- When 5 minutes are left popup a warning.
- After time limit expires always kill the blocked processes.
- Reset time after midnight.

Not doing for Sprint 1:

- No MVVM.
- GUI code can be thrown away after Sprint 1 and re-done from scratch if need be.

Sprint 2:

- lameover runs in background and popups warning with 1 minute kill delay on any new attempt to start banned processes
  after timeout+kill has already happened.
- Be able to pick the banned process names out of a window populated from current processes.
- Make lameover low priority. Research hooks that don't require always running.
- Assembly packaging.

# What is lameover?

An aid to play less video games.

It will nag like a "clock in a casino."

# Roadmap

## Sprint 2

New Features:
* TTS nag.

Changes:
* Nag repeats itself instead of just firing off once.

## Future sprints

Features:
* Nice to have - Pick the procrastination process names out of a window of current processes.
* Not sure - Instead of just process name, be able to see what URL browsers are on.
* Overlay 3D session w/ popup in addition to the audio nag.

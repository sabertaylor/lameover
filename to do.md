# New concept

Before lameover was going to be a process killer, after you play a game too long, but now I'm thinking more of popup nag. Like a clock in a casino, reminded every half hour how long you've wasted time.

The blocker has been writing a DirectX popup, during games. It will be simple to implement once I find the right API since there's plenty of other software that does overlays.
